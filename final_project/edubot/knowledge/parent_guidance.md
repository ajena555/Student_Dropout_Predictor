## Guidance for Parents

If the app predicts that a student is at risk of dropping out, parents should:

- Stay calm and approach the situation supportively.
- Talk to the student without judgment and understand their challenges.
- Work closely with teachers and school counselors to create a support plan.
- Ensure a stable and encouraging environment at home.
- Promote time management, goal setting, and academic support.

Remember: early intervention and empathy go a long way.
